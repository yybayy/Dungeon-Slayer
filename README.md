Roguelite Dungeon-Slaying Game is a 2D action game that combines procedural gameplay with strategic progression. Inspired by classic roguelite mechanics, the game features a node-based level system that allows for non-linear exploration, branching paths, and replayability. Each node on the map represents a unique challenge — combat encounters, events, shops, or random rewards — making every run feel different from the last.

The game uses event-driven movement and behavior logic powered by ScriptableObjects, enabling a modular and scalable architecture. This approach makes it easy to design enemies, items, or environmental effects without hardcoding, supporting a highly flexible development workflow.

Built with Unity, this project focuses on core gameplay mechanics, dynamic difficulty balancing, and creating an engaging combat experience with a lightweight yet robust system.

Key features include:

Node-based level generation and progression system

Modular character and enemy abilities using ScriptableObjects

Event-driven architecture for movement, combat, and game logic

Replayable roguelite structure with increasing difficulty

Easily extensible content system for future expansions

This project is a work in progress and aims to be a learning-friendly example of using Unity’s architecture for creating complex yet maintainable gameplay systems.
